    "Surface hopping is a *mixed quantum-classical technique* that incorporates quantum mechanical effects into molecular dynamics simulations. Traditional molecular dynamics assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the lighter electrons adjust instantaneously to the motion of the nuclei. Though the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is applicable to a wide range of problems, there are several applications, such as photoexcited dynamics, electron transfer, and surface chemistry where this approximation falls apart. Surface hopping partially incorporates the non-adiabatic effects by including excited adiabatic surfaces in the calculations, and allowing for 'hops' between these surfaces, subject to certain criteria. One of the most famous criteria is the so-called **fewest-switches** algorithm proposed by *John C. Tully*, which *minimizes the number of hops required to maintain the population in various adiabatic states*.\n",

    "As can be clearly seen from the picture, the MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ vdW heterostructure is of **type-II** band alignment, where the CBM and VBM reside on different constituent TMD layers. Therefore, in this system, we can study the dynamics of photo-generated electron from WS$_2$ to MoS$_2$ or dynamics of photo-generated hole from MoS$_2$ to WS$_2$.\n",

    "* The supercell should be large enough, since *the Brillouin Zone in all the calculation hereafter will be sampled only at $\\Gamma$ point*. Needless to say, the supercell should not be too large, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The shape or size of the supercell should be chosen carefully. The shape of the supercell is not uniquely defined. For example, in our case of MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructure, we can either choose a hexagonal supercell or a tetragonal supercell as was used in our paper. If you choose our supercell to be hexagonal, then only $3n\\times 3n$ supercell should be chosen, since otherwise the $K$ point will not fold onto the $\\Gamma$ point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the supercell is determined, perform a geometry optimization and get the optimized structure. <font color='red'>Note that Gammon-only version of VASP should be used to do the calculations, since we only sample the BZ by $\\Gamma$-point and Gamma-only version of VASP will speed up the calculation by ~50%.</font>\n",

    "Now that we have the optimized structure, the next step is to obtain a molecular dynamics trajectory. First, we need to do an equilibration molecular dynamics to add thermal energy to the optimized structure. Below is an example VASP `INCAR` file that uses the *velocity-rescaling* method (`SMASS = -1`) to bring the temperature of the system to 300 K. The optimized structure in the last step is used as the `POSCAR` file and the `KPOINTS` file only contains the $\\Gamma$ point."
